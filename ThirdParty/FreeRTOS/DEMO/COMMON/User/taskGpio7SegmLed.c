 * This version of flash .c is for use on systems that have limited stack space
 * and no display facilities.  The complete version can be found in the 
 * Demo/Common/Full directory.
 * 
 * Three tasks are created, each of which flash an LED at a different rate.  The first 
 * LED flashes every 200ms, the second every 400ms, the third every 600ms.
 *
 * The LED flash tasks provide instant visual feedback.  They show that the scheduler 
 * is still operational.
